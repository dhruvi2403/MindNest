# MindNest Application Fixes Implemented

## Issue 1: Assessment using wrong questions ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Assessment pages were fetching questions from `/api/assessment/questions` instead of using hardcoded questions
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed API fetch calls from `DynamicAssessmentPage.jsx`
  - Modified component to use `questions` prop directly
  - Updated submission to send answers to Python ML API (`VITE_ML_API_URL`)
  - Added fallback results when ML service is unavailable

## Issue 2: 404/500 on /api calls ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: CORS errors and missing proxy configuration
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced CORS configuration in `backend/server.js` with proper preflight handling
  - Added Vite proxy in `vite.config.js` to route `/api` calls to `http://localhost:5000`
  - Updated frontend to use relative `/api/...` URLs instead of absolute URLs
  - Added proper error handling for 401/403 responses with login redirects

## Issue 3: Therapist onboarding modal not showing ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Modal wasn't appearing for new therapist users
- **Solution**:
  - Added `POST /api/therapists/ensure` endpoint in `backend/routes/therapists.js`
  - Modified `TherapistOnboardingModal.jsx` to use the ensure endpoint
  - Added onboarding check in `TherapistDashboard.jsx` on component mount
  - Modal now shows automatically for therapists with `onboarded: false`

## Issue 4: Slot blocking & availability ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: No unique constraints on appointment slots
- **Solution**:
  - Added unique compound index `{ therapistId, date, time }` in appointment schema
  - Updated appointment booking route to return 409 status for slot conflicts
  - Enhanced frontend error handling to show "slot taken" message for 409 responses
  - Improved availability checking in booking logic

## Issue 5: Dashboards not showing dynamic DB data ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Missing database methods and stats endpoints
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented comprehensive appointment methods in `backend/lib/db.js`:
    - `findByTherapistIdAndDate`, `findUpcomingByTherapist`, `findScheduledByClient`
    - `countByTherapistId`, `countUniqueClientsByTherapistId`, etc.
  - Added stats endpoints in `backend/routes/therapists.js` and `backend/routes/clients.js`
  - Enhanced error handling with try/catch blocks and proper HTTP status codes

## Issue 6: Assessment → Python ML integration ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Assessment was sending data to Node backend instead of Python ML service
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `DynamicAssessmentPage.jsx` to send answers directly to Python API
  - Python ML service already had CORS enabled for `http://localhost:5173`
  - Added fallback results display when ML service is unavailable
  - Frontend now shows "ML service unavailable" note when appropriate

## Issue 7: Environment & startup ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Missing environment configuration files
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `backend/env.example` with required variables:
    - `PORT=5000`, `MONGODB_URI=...`, `JWT_SECRET=...`
  - Created `env.example` for frontend with `VITE_ML_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/predict`
  - Fixed Python ML service port from 5000 to 8000 to avoid conflicts

## Issue 8: TherapistDashboard fetch errors ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Dashboard was crashing on fetch errors and using undefined `token` variable
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed token retrieval in both `Dashboard.jsx` and `TherapistDashboard.jsx`
  - Added proper error handling for 401/403 responses with login redirects
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling for missing tokens
  - Added therapist onboarding check and modal integration

## Additional Improvements Made

### Database Schema Updates
- Fixed appointment schema to use `time` instead of `startTime/endTime`
- Added unique compound index for appointment slots
- Updated status enum to include "confirmed" status

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- Implemented proper HTTP status codes (409 for conflicts, 401/403 for auth)
- Added fallback mechanisms for service unavailability

### Security
- Enhanced CORS configuration with specific origins
- Added proper authentication token validation
- Implemented automatic login redirects for unauthorized access

### User Experience
- Added loading states and error messages
- Implemented fallback results for ML service failures
- Enhanced appointment booking with better conflict handling

## Startup Instructions

1. **Start MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running on `mongodb://localhost:27017/mindnest`
2. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && npm start` (runs on port 5000)
3. **Start Python ML Service**: `cd scripts && python ml_service.py` (runs on port 8000)
4. **Start Frontend**: `npm run dev` (runs on port 5173 with proxy to backend)

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend (.env)
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mindnest
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend (.env.local)
```
VITE_ML_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/predict
```

All issues have been resolved and the application should now work properly with:
- Proper CORS handling
- Working assessment system with ML integration
- Functional dashboards with real-time data
- Proper appointment booking with slot conflict prevention
- Therapist onboarding flow
- Comprehensive error handling and user experience improvements
